# Unit Testing For Library Project

### Explanation
* i have made an a dll project from all of my classes and services that i used in the Library-Project and connected it to this project
  (if you wanna do it by your own you need to copy Model,Enums,Services,DataBase Folders and paste it in dll project)

* Good Luck!!!!
